Diabetes Progression Predictor

Diabetes is a chronic disease that alters how the body turns food into energy. Food is normally broken down into simple sugars (glucose) and released into the bloodstream. Insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas) helps the glucose pass from the bloodstream into the cells. In diabetic patients, the pancreas can no longer make insulin or cannot adequately use the insulin it does produce. Without careful management, diabetes can lead to dangerous complications.

This linear regression model is used to predict disease progression one year after the baseline. The data comes from a study by Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone, and Robert Tibshirani (2004) titled "Least Angle Regression," Annals of Statistics.

The source URL provides detailed information about the dataset, variables, and also reference links, including the dataset link.

The dataset contains n=422 observations and ten baseline variables:

age: age in years 
sex: sex 
bmi: body mass index 
bp: average blood pressure 
s1: tc, total serum cholesterol 
s2: ldl, low-density lipoproteins 
s3: hdl, high-density lipoproteins 
s4: tch, total cholesterol / HDL 
s5: ltg, possibly log of serum triglycerides level 
s6: glu, blood sugar level

Data Set Characteristics Number of Instances: 442 Number of Attributes First 10 columns are numeric predictive values Target: Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline Attribute Information.It is the variable of interest.
